# youtubetomp3downloader - the node package - ver 1.0.3


Convert youtube videos to the mp3 format and download the tracks into your computer / phone.

This is the node package that I've published and that you can download if you'd want to make any changes. 

If you just want to use the source code of the API, it's in this repository: [LINK]

This is included in the API by using npm install --save sindat-youtube-mp3, and then require('sindat-youtube-mp3'); in your code.
